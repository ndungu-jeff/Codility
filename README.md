Challenge 1: CamelCase Method(Toy Problem)

Write simple .camelCase method for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

'hello case'.camelcase => HelloCase

'camel case word'.camelcase => CamelCaseWord


Challenge 2

"abcde" + "cdefgh" => "abcdefgh"
"abaab" + "aabab" => "abaabab"
"abc" + "def" => "abcdef"
"abc" + "abc" => "abc"
